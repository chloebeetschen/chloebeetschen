🎓 I am Chloe Beetschen a 3rd year University of Leeds student, persuing an Integrated Masters in Computer Science (BSc, MEng). In summer of 2023 I completed a summer internship at GFT working on cloud solutions (GCP and Terraform) and data (strategies, science and architectures). This internship has also improved my knowledge of Agile and CI/CD, having completed many LinkedIn Learning courses to expand my skills and expertise, and through applied learning with the use of Azure DevOps and Scrum Meetings.

👨‍💻 I also have experience in website/webapp building (both front-end and back-end), as well as python and java experience building smaller projects or games.
Another passion of mine also lies in Cyber Security, I am in the process of working towards by Cyber Technician and CEH certifications.

🌱 I’m currently working and learning how to use python, html, JS and django to create a social media chat application to be able to initialise and transfer this into another seperate web application I am working on. 

🎸 Outside of code, my hobbies range from football, being an avid player, captain and supporter, to skiing and snowboarding. I also enjoy travelling, having visted many of the capitals and great cities of Europe in the last year. 

📚 I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.
